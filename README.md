# Getting started with R
These are a series of tutorials designed for journalists interested in learning R and RStudio, however they would be helpful to anyone wanting to get started. These lessons focus on the Tidyverse packages and a few others that I've found to be super useful and it covers basic data analysis concepts. If you previously learned Excel or SQL, you will recognize a lot of similar concepts, however it's not necessary that you know those other programs to get started with these tutorials.

They are designed to walk you through data that is mostly pre-written, but then opportunities for you to write your own code, as well. The DIY lessons are ones that you would create entirely from scratch (with answers provided). 

# 1- Setting up R
This is just a short video that walks you through installing R and RStudio; launching RStudio and installing a few packages. There is an R script included here that has code you can use to install all the packages needed for the subsequent tutorials.

# 2 - Gentle Introduction
This has a short video and data that you can use to create your first project and Notebook script, and get a taste of some of the code from Tidyverse that we'll use for data analysis.

# 3 - Tidyverse
This is where we really get moving with importing data and going through the main components of Tidyverse's dplyr package for basic data analysis

# 4 - Death data analysis
This is a continuation of the previous exercise, but this time using more complex data from the Minnesota death certificates database. Brief introduction to making plots with ggplot2.

# 5 - Cleaning data
This shows you some basic cleanup, recoding and rearranging techniques such as pivot_wider and pivot_longer.

# 6 - Importing and Joining
This focuses on how to import csv and Excel files, as well as joining and appending data, but also offers additional practice in some data recoding, a basic plot and basic analysis.

# 7 - Making graphics with ggplot2
This runs through the basics of ggplot2, covering bar/column charts, line charts, stacked bar charts and scatterplot, as well as tips for making your charts look good (titles, axis styling, etc). This also introduces you to using an RMarkdown page.

# 8 - Tidycensus
This is an introduction to a package called tidycensus that is designed to make it easier for you to get Census data from the U.S. Census Bureau's API. It also includes a brief introduction to doing some mapping in R using that data.  YOU WILL NEED AN API KEY FROM CENSUS FOR THIS. Directions are in the tutorial.

# 9 - RMarkdown
This tutorial shows you how to write your code in an RMarkdown file and then "knit" it into a pretty HTML page (with the option of hiding your code). This is a great way to make a beautiful presentation of your findings to share with others. It also shows you some other formatting tools such as the formattable package and the DT package for making a searchable, sortable table.

# 10 - COVID exercise
This is a way to put many of your new skills to practice on a full data analysis. It also shows you how to download data from a live URL (in this case, the New York Times COVID cases and deaths data by county). 

# 11 -- Building permits exercise
This is also a full analysis of a dataset, putting many of your new skills to work. This is residential building permit data from the Twin Cities. 

# DIY
You will find three exercises that you can do yourself and they include an answer sheet you can check when you are finished. The police_shootings and salaries exercises would be appropriate after getting through the first 4 tutorials. The student_diversity one would be best for after getting through exercise 6.
